Declare constants like the width of the board and the clours. 
The colors are put in an array. 
We create the board using an array, first we have to figure out how many
squares make up our board, the width will be 8 and height will be 8,
which will be 64. We use reandom colors to make up 64 squares, it is done
using functional expression.

Problem 1: Write a function to generate 64 random colors from an array
of 6 random colors and push the random colors into an array. Save the
array to state using "useState hook"

Problem 2: How to stop re-rendering and prevent an infinite loop.
Ans: By using "useEffect"

Problem 3: Write a function to check for column of 3.
Ans: Loop over squares.
